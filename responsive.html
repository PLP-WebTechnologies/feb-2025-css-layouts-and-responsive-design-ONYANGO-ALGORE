    <p>this is new text and I don't have a lot of text to think about,
    so I will just add a few more words to make it look like a real paragraph. I hope this is enough text to fill the space and make it look good. If not, I can always add more later. 
    But for now, this should do the trick. Let's see how it looks when it's all put together. I think it will be fine.</p>
